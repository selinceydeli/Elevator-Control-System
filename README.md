# Elevator-Control-System
Logic and Digital Systems Design Term Project: Designing a simple elevator control system and implementing it on the FPGA device

Users can control the elevator using buttons and switches and monitor the status of the elevator from the LEDs and seven-segment display in the FPGA

Used Vivado IDE and Verilog programming language for designing the elevator control system
